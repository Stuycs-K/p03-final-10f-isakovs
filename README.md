### Group Name: WorkSmarter

Samuel Isakov

### Project Description:

This project aims to provide a means to distribute a program's execution over several computers.

This would make the program execute faster than if it was run only on one computer.

### Instructions:

Installation and Execution:

Clone the repo.

Run "make compile"

Run "make intgen" to generate an 8gb random integer data file for testing purposes. The file will take a few minutes to generate.

Run "make master" on the intended master computer, to open the control center and spawn nodes from there.

Interaction:

The user is prompted for instructions on the master computer, and all interaction is explained and conducted on that master computer.

Quit the program by pressing Ctrl+C.

### Resources/ References:

To be decided
