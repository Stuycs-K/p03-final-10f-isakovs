### Group Name: WorkSmarter

Samuel Isakov

### Project Description:

This project aims to provide a means to distribute a program's execution over several computers.

This would make the program execute faster than if it was run only on one computer.

### Instructions:

Installation and Execution:

Clone the repo.

Run "make compile"

Run "make master" on the intended master computer, to open the control center and listen to node connections.

Afterwards, run "make node" on every computer that is intended to be a node, it will connect to the master and serve its requests.

Interaction:

The user is prompted for instructions on the master computer, and all interaction is explained and conducted on that master computer.

Node computers' terminals only show what that node is being ordered to do, interaction is disabled there except for quitting the program.

Quit the program(s) by pressing Ctrl+C.

### Resources/ References:

To be decided
