### Project Description:

This project aims to provide a means to distribute a program's execution over several computers.

This would make the program execute faster than if it was run only on one computer.

### Instructions:

Installation and Execution:

Clone the repo.

Run "make compile"

Run "make intgen" to generate an 8gb random integer data file to test program 1, File Scanning. The file will take a few minutes to generate.

Run "make run" on the intended master computer, to open the control center and spawn nodes from there.

Interaction:

The user is prompted for instructions on the master computer, and all interaction is explained and conducted on that master computer.

Four programs are available to test, File Scanning, Bogosort, Pi Approximation, and Mandelbrot Set plotting.

Quit the program by pressing Ctrl+C.

### Resources/ References:

For the Mandelbrot Set, .ppm files can be viewed in this website: https://bytes.usc.edu/~saty/tools/PGMViewer/viewer.html

No external libraries were used in this project.
