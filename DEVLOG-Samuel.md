### 2026-01-07 - Writing boilerplate and importing networking.
I wrote the boilerplate for the codebase, including the makefile.
I imported the server and client handshakes from lab 16. I intend to use these handshakes for more advanced use cases than that seen in lab 16.
Also I did some research and thinking about how a master computer can send commands to nodes, thinking about fork() and execvp().
